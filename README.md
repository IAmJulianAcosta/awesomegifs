# Julian Acosta take home test

## Run
- `git clone git@github.com:IAmJulianAcosta/soapboxtest.git`
- `rename .env.example to .env`
- `add your giphy API key`
- `ember serve` 

## Online version
Go to https://soapbox.julianacosta.me

## TODO / Out of scope of the test
- The API key is stored in the client, so it is exposed. Ideally requests should be proxied to prevent this
